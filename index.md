## Guiding Questions and Workshop Goal 
How do I find spatial themes in my data? What story do I want to tell? Which tools and mediums best fit my desired outcome, current skillset, and timeframe?

    
Design a workshop for developing the skills to tell spatial stories with data. This workshop is not about teaching one single software or technical workflow but rather learning to ask strategic questions so as to determine what stories to tell and how to go about doing it. This workshop could potentially be carried out over two sessions. In the first session, we would focus on methodology and (decision trees) and modality (giving resources/examples). In the second session, we could invite participants to bring their own dataset and work together (or be led through an exemplar) to put into practice skills learned in session one. (Bringing a dataset would not be a requirement for attendance, though participation in session 1 would be prerequisite.) This workshop is like a wayfinding tutorial for navigating what questions to ask and what tools to use to tell the spatial stories of data. This workshop could be initially held as a two day intensive during GIS Week (November 2024), then held the following semester as a series. 

Audience: Digital Humanties people, Geographers, and anyone who wants to make a reference map for their article or have spatial data they want to analyze. Etc.
