# Telling Spatial Stories with Data
    
*How do I tell spatial stories with my data? What tools best suit my audience, skillset, resources, and timeframe?* This workshop will guide you through answering these questions. Rather than focusing on a single software or technical workflow, participants will be introduced to a variety of methods, tools, and platforms while learning to evaluate each for its applicability to the spatial story at hand. Think of this workshop as a wayfinding tutorial for navigating what questions to ask yourself at the beginning of a project comprising spatial data. By the end of this workshop series, participants will be able to:

- Design a project to tell a spatial story with your data
- Identify suitable methods/tools/platforms to visualize your data and convey your research
- Inventory and assemble the necessary resources to begin mapping


## When & Where
This workshop will be launched across two afternoons of GIS week 2024: **Wednesday, November 20th & Thursday, November 21st, from 1 - 3pm PST**. During the first session, you will be guided through key concepts of project design. You will also be introduced to a variety of mapping tools, and given the opportunity to evaluate which platforms and methods best suit your data, audience, and research objectives. In the second session, you will put into practice the skills learned on day one. Additionally, **participants are encouraged to bring their own projects/datasets to work through in applied learning.** 


## Prerequisites
1. Attendance to Session 1 is prerequisite for attendance to Session 2. Register for [Session 1 here](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/event/3845835) and [Session 2 here](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/event/3845836).

2. If you are attending this workshop with a project of your own in mind, please download and fill out, to the best of your ability, the below worksheet. This is for your own benefit, and will not be collected or assessed by facilitators. You will also have a chance to fill it out during Session 1, though it may be helpful to get a head start.
