# Spatial Stories
    
How do I tell spatial stories with my data? What tools and mediums best suit my audience, skillset, resources, and timeframe? This workshop will guide you through answering these questions. Rather than focusing on a single software or technical workflow, participants will be introduced to a variety of methods and platforms while learning to evaluate each for its applicability/suitibility to the task/dataset/story at hand. Think of this workshop as a wayfinding tutorial for navigating what questions to ask yourself at the beginning of a project comprising spatial data. 


This workshop will initially be facilitated across two afternoons of GIS week, Day/Time/Location and Day/Time/Location. The first day wil focus on ~methodology and (decision trees) and modality (giving resources/examples). The second day we will go through exemplar project to put into practice skills learned in session one. Additionally, participants are invited to bring their own projects/datasets so as to work together applying what learned. 

Attendance in session 1 is prerequisite for attendance in session 2. (any other prerequisites?)

Not sure if this workshop is for you? Audience: Digital Humanties people, Geographers, and anyone who wants to make a reference map for their article or have spatial data they want to analyze. Etc.
