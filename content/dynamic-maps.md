## Web Maps 
Webmaps are.... Examples of what you can show --> examples of two technologies, as well as QGIS --> web. You can create all the same thematic maps, just hosted on the web. Two popular software --> Leaflet and Mapbox.


### Leaflet
- What is leaflet? requires learn code --> give resources and example leaflet maps
Resources here? 
- [Intro to Leaflet](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-leaflet/) workshop

### Mapbox 
What it is, what it can do, pros cons etc. Studio vs coding.
