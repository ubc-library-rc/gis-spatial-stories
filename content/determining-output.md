# Determining the output

There are two main ways to share a spatial story: static maps or dynamic visuals. **Static maps** tell a spatial story at a single scale. Static maps can be exported as an image or PDF for print or digital publication. They can also be included in an academic paper, poster, or flyer. **Dynamic maps**, on the other hand, allow the user to interact with your spatial story. Dynamic maps display data in an interactive fashion, allowing viewers to pan, zoom, click, and scroll to reveal layered information at different scales. Learn more about the pros and cons of static vs. dynamic maps [here](https://www.line-45.com/post/static-maps-vs-interactive-maps-when-use-them).

## Keep in mind...
In order to determine what output best suits your project and capacities, it's helpful to explore some examples. The following subpages introduce different kinds of static and dynamic maps. Remember, there is usually more than one way to create a desired output. 

The final section of this workshop, **Assembling Resources**, will evaluate different software/tool options based on criteria such as accessability and learning curve. For now, focus on determining what the output format of your spatial story will be. As you go, keep in mind the following **Project Design** questions:
  
 > - Who is your audience? Who is your spatial story for? To whom should it be legible?

  > - How do you want your audience to interact/engage with your story? Will it be a stand-alone graphic or integrated somehow in a publication or website?

  > - Thinking back to your overarching project objectives, is the purpose of your story to provide contextual spatial reference, convey a narrative, or visualize the results of some analysis? 
  
  > - Do you want your output to be a static map, or something more dynamic and interactive hosted on the web? 

  > - It can be helpful in this stage to gather some examples that approximate your desired output. From where do you draw inspiration?
