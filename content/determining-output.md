# Determining the output

In order to determine what output best suits your project and capacities, it's helpful to see some examples. 

There are two ways to share a spatial story: either a static or dynamic visual. **Static maps** tell a spatial story at a single scale. Static maps can be exported/stored/formatted as an image (.jpeg or .png), can be exported as a pdf, printed or embedded digitally into website or publication. They can be included in an academic paper, poster, or flyer. **Dynamic maps**, on the other hand, allow the user to interact with your spatial story. Dynamic display data in --- way -- at multiple scales, allowing zoom in and out and panning. They are not designed to be printed out, but rather hosted on the web either by a local server or internet hosting platform. 

The following subpages break down different kinds of static and dynamic maps with examples.... As you go, keep in mind the questions from Project Design 
  
 > - Who is your audience? Who is your spatial story for? To whom should it be legible?

  > - How do you want your audience to interact/engage with your story? Will it be a stand-alone graphic or integrated somehow in a publication or website?

  > - Thinking back to your overarching project objectives, is the purpose of your story to provide contextual spatial reference, convey a narrative, or visualize the results of some analysis? 
  
  > - Do you want your output to be a static map, or something more dynamic and interactive hosted on the web? 

  > - It can be helpful in this stage to gather some examples that approximate your desired output. From where do you draw inspiration?

There is usually more than one way to create a desired output, and the final step/page group, **Assembling Resources** will guide you through different software/tools once you've determined what your output will be. 

<!-- Questions to ask/considerations to think through which is best for you/ your project. the sub-pages walk you through how to do each and give free and open source options at a variety experience levels.  -->

<!-- give example of reference map both as static image and web map. Give example of choropleth symbol map as both static and web. Still need to consider how to introduce platforms and resources. maybe this page can be to further work out the most suitible output format, and then the tools/platform/resources page can offer a variety of ways to make that format given constraints on time/resources/skills  -->
