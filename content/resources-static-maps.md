### Resources for making static reference maps

Resources --> you can use GIS but also google maps and some other options. 

 > - (include resources here? or under assembling resources page? or break the subpages for Determining Output into These subcategories instead of Static/Dynaic? If I include under Assembling Resources, I can both break down the different softwares and provide resources for learning them...  Is there a way to simply hint here to what tools to look further into in the next section)

GIS 

| Software/Platform | Description | Difficulty/knowledge required | Resources |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| **QGIS** | QGIS is a free and open source GIS software you can [download](https://qgis.org/download/) on nearly any operating system.  | Medium - learning curve but --- | QGIS has extensive online documentation, including a robust [User Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/index.html#) *and* [Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/index.html).QGIS also has a vibrant user community, with answers to nearly any question you might have only a web search away. Many helpful tutorial demonstrations can be found on Youtube. UBC Research Commons' 2 workshops highly recommend to get you started: [Intro to Map Production with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) and [Tools and Workflows in QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-tools-workflows/) |
| **ArcGIS** | ArcGIS is a proprietary desktop GIS that requires either a personal or institutional license. If you are faculty or student at UBC - liscence. Also can login? in digital scholarship lab. only runs on windows. taught in GIS classes but most things you can do in QGIS. benifits=tools etc. | Medium - takes a while to get familiar with interface. theres lots there that you likely wont need. |ArcGIS resources --> check out software examples see if its for you. |
