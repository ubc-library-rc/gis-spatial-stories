## Geographic Information Systems

### QGIS
QGIS is a popular desktop GIS software, and considered a **f**ree and **o**pen **s**ource **s**oftware **(FOSS)** with a very active development community. According to [QGIS's development roadmap](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html), new versions are planned for release as far as 2 years into the future. For this workshop we are using QGIS 3.28.10 'Firenze', the most recent long term release.

Medium learning curve. ... what else? useful to know for so many things. 

#### QGIS Advantages  ⇡
{: .no_toc}
- Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
- Extensive [online documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)
- Active development and user communities, meaning what?
- Robust plugin repository for extended functionality, meaning what?

#### QGIS Disadvantages ⇣
{: .no_toc}
- Most recent features can be buggy, which is why we recommend always downloading the latest Long Term Release, often small button below main download. 
- Plugins lack standardized documentation
- Troubleshooting = Googling 

#### QGIS Resources 
{: .no_toc}
QGIS has extensive online documentation, including a robust [User Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/index.html#) *and* [Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/index.html).QGIS also has a vibrant user community, with answers to nearly any question you might have only a web search away. Many helpful tutorial demonstrations can be found on Youtube. UBC Research Commons' 2 workshops highly recommend to get you started: [Intro to Map Production with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) and [Tools and Workflows in QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-tools-workflows/)


### ArcGIS Pro 
ArcGIS is a proprietary desktop GIS that requires either a personal or institutional license. If you are faculty or student at UBC - liscence. Also can login? in digital scholarship lab. only runs on windows. taught in GIS classes but most things you can do in QGIS. benifits=tools etc.
Learning curve? Medium - takes a while to get familiar with interface. theres lots there that you likely wont need.
