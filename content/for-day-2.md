# Preparing for Day 2

In the second session, you will put into practice the skills learned on today by working through a project of your own, or thinking through the project of another participant. You are encouraged to bring your own ideas, datasets, and projects in any stage. 

To prepare, make your way through the Project Design worksheet and answer the questions as best you can. Try out some of the different tools introduced today. Even if you don't intend to use every tool, it can be fun to simply explore their capacities.
