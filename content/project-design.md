# Project Design 
{: .no_toc}

The purpose of this workshop is to guide you through exploring the spatial aspect of your data so as to tell a spatial story. Depending on your data and overarching project, you will begin with a varying degree of certainty around what story you want to tell and how you will go about composing it. Therefore, we will begin by asking some questions to articulate the objectives, constraints, and resources you are working with. This, in turn, will help you decide on an output format and the best tools to make it happen. 

As you reflect on the following questions, it can be helpful to write down your answers to refer to later. If that sounds useful for you, a Project Design Worksheet may be downloaded here:

## 1. Articulating Objectives
The first question to ask yourself is: *What are my overarching project objectives?* If your spatial story is just one aspect of a larger project, how will your spatial story contribute to the project as a whole? 

  - What are you trying to show spatially? For example, change over time? A voyage, itinerary, or historical timeline? The location of a city, town, country, or research area? The density or dispersal of an attribute across different locales? <!-- if you wanna do this, then you might do this -- link page / output, method -->



## 2. Identifying Constraints 
Constraints, such as those around time and resources, limit what you can do. However, by identifying your constraints before beginning a project you actually enable yourself to explore within reason, taking on only as much as you can handle. Below are some questions to get you thinking about what constraints you may have. Feel welcome to jot down those specific to your project in your worksheet. 

  - What is your timeframe/timeline? Are there benchmarks for progress, ie, when you'd like to get various stages done by? To whom are you accountable?

  - Are you working alone or within a team? If working with others, it can be helpful to identify who is responsible for what before you begin. 


  - Is your spatial story for your own project, or are there client specifications you must take into consideration? 

  - What skills do you have that are relevant to the project you are undertaking? Do you have time/interest/capacity to learn new skills? Reflecting on just how much energy you can put into the project at hand will guide you in choosing what tools/platforms to construct your spatial story with. 



## 3. Determining Output 
Determining the format of your output will enable you to assess and assemble the necessary resources. If you already have an idea of the output you want, take a moment to sketch it out or describe it with words. Otherwise, reflect on the following questions:
  
  - Who is your audience? Who is your spatial story for? To whom should it be legible?

  - How do you want your audience to interact/engage with your story? Will it be a stand-alone graphic or integrated somehow in a publication or website?

  - Thinking back to your objectives, is the purpose of your story to provide contextual spatial reference, convey a narrative, or visualize spatial data? 
  
  - Do you want your output to be a static map, or something more dynamic and interactive hosted on the web? 

  - It can be helpful in this stage to gather some examples that approximate your desired output. From where do you draw inspiration? 


## 4. Assembling Resources
After you have a sense of your objectives, constraints, and intended output format, you can begin inventorying your data and assembling additional resources that suit your project's goals. Questions to ask yourself at this stage include:

 - What data do you have? What data do you need?

 - What aspect of your data is spatial? 

 - What format is your data in (eg csv, text, image, geospatial file, ...) Do you need to convert any of it into a different format? Is your data in current format legible to the software you intend to use?

- How are you managing and storing your data? Will you and everyone who needs to have access to everything for the duration of this project? 

- What software, tools, platforms do you have access to?

- What tools/methods/platforms are relevant? This might be a question to circle back to after working through the next page.

#### Resources for Project Design
{: .no_toc}
Finally, it is useful to make a list of resources that can support you along your journey. This could be tutorials, colleagues, supervisors, or consultants. UBC Library Research Commons offers 1:1 and group consultations for GIS related questions, as well as questions regarding Data Analysis, Digital Scholarship, Citation Management: [Book a consult here](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/appointments/research_commons). There are also numerous workshops from all of these clusters you can work through asynchronously: [see workshop archive here](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/). Keep in mind consultations offered through the Research Commons are aimed at assisting you as you work through your project rather than creating a methodology for you.
