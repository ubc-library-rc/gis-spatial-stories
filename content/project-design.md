# Project Design 
{: .no_toc}

The purpose of this workshop is to guide you through exploring the spatial aspect of your data so as to tell a spatial story. Depending on your data and overarching project, you will begin with a varying degree of certainty around what story you want to tell and how you will go about composing it. Therefore, we will begin by asking some questions - to get a clearer idea about the objectives, constraints, output, and resources you are working with.

## 1. Articulating Objectives
<!-- What do you want to The first question to ask yourself is: *What are my overarching project objectives?*

Give examples of different objectives -->

- What are you trying to show spatially? For example, change over time? Movement? Perhaps a voyage or itinerary? The location of a city, town, country, or research area? The density or relative concentration of an attribute in different locales?<!-- if you wanna do this, then you might do this -- link page / output, method -->
- Is the spatial story auxiliary to the rest of your project or the focus? If the spatial is just one aspect, how will your visual be integrated with the rest of your work?
- Who is your audience?



## 2. Evaluating Constraints 
- What is your timeframe? It can be helpful to map out the time you have and estimate - benchmarks along the way
- Are you working alone or within a team? Identifying who is responsible for what before you begin... 
- What skills do you have relevant to your project? Do you have time/capacity/interest in learning new skills? 
- Is this map for you or are there client specifications you must take into consideration? 


## 3. Determining Output 
- Determining the format of your output will enable you to assess and assemble the necessary resources. Will your output be a static reference or thematic map? Or will it be a dynamic map such as an interactive webmap, timeline, or storymap? Are you making 1 map or a series of maps? It can be helpful in this stage to sketch out some possibilities by hand, as well as gather some examples that approximate your desired output. From where do you draw inspiration? 
 
  
## 4. Assembling Resources
After you have a sense of your objectives, constraints, and intended output format, you can begin inventorying your data and assembling additional resources, tools, platforms that suit your project's goals. Questions to ask yourself at this stage include:
 - What data do you have? What data do you need?
 - What format is your data in (eg csv, text, image, geospatial file, ...)
 - What aspect of your data is spatial? 
 - What tools/methods/platforms are relevant?
 - What software, tools, platforms do you have access to?  Do you prefer open source?
 - Is your data in current format legible to the software you intend to use?
- How are you managing and storing your data? Will you and everyone who needs to have access to everything for the duration of this project?
