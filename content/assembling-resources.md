- location names in story
- city names in spreadsheet (could just make google map)
- coordinate points in spreadsheet
- geospatial data (shapefile, raster, gejson etc)
- street addresses
- historical map
- no data at all but want to depict research area or fieldsite

what is your data type? are there any location based attributes?
 (street address, geographic coordinates, city, town, country?) is there a map? (skills: geocoding, georeferencing, projecting)
	
## What is the relation of this data to your project 
Is the spatial story auxiliary to the rest of the project? Integrated?
