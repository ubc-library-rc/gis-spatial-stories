# Assembling Resources

Once you've articulated your objectives and enabling constraints and decided on an output format that best suits the story you want to tell, it's time to assemble the necessary resources. This involves a bit of consideration, thinking with your constraints... Returning to some of the project design questions now more clearly relevant...

1. Assemble and Prepare Data
2. Decide on tools/platforms
3. Design workflow 
4. troubleshooting etc. 

## 1. Assemble your Data

- resources for finding data etc. 
- note where you're storing it and licenses/attribution etc, where you got it from
- make any modifications/transformations (FME is good for interoperability and gives out student licenses)

- How to determine what's so spatial about your data.... 
		(st addressses, then geocode)
		(given cities, spatial join to city layer in qgis OR add columns for xy data - copy paste from google maps )
		(coordinates, display xy )
		(draw layer aoi in qgis)
	^this all shows the myriad of ways data can be spatial 
    spatializing data --> (geocoding, displaying xy data)
	data analysis 
- also note on making data format legible to software/tool you want to use... 

<!-- what is your data type? are there any location based attributes?
 (street address, geographic coordinates, city, town, country?) is there a map? (skills: geocoding, georeferencing, projecting) -->
	

## Tools/Platforms/Software 
Give examples not only of tools/platforms but also resources to learn how to use them/or to use them in the specific way of making static maps.

(need different words for 'difficulty')

Re do table so its about output matched with options, then below for each option do bullet points for each of the categories currently in table

| Software/Platform | Description | Difficulty/knowledge required | Resources |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| **QGIS** | QGIS is a free and open source GIS software you can [download](https://qgis.org/download/) on nearly any operating system.  | Medium - learning curve but --- | QGIS has extensive online documentation, including a robust [User Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/index.html#) *and* [Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/index.html).QGIS also has a vibrant user community, with answers to nearly any question you might have only a web search away. Many helpful tutorial demonstrations can be found on Youtube. UBC Research Commons' 2 workshops highly recommend to get you started: [Intro to Map Production with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) and [Tools and Workflows in QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-tools-workflows/) |
| **ArcGIS** | ArcGIS is a proprietary desktop GIS that requires either a personal or institutional license. If you are faculty or student at UBC - liscence. Also can login? in digital scholarship lab. only runs on windows. taught in GIS classes but most things you can do in QGIS. benifits=tools etc. | Medium - takes a while to get familiar with interface. theres lots there that you likely wont need. |ArcGIS resources --> check out software examples see if its for you. |
| Google Maps | granny smith | free things, very beginner friendly, no experience necessary, useful if you just want to create a point map |links for google maps |
[MapOSMatic](https://print.get-map.org/)| "MapOSMatic is a free software webservice to generate maps of cities using OpenStreetMap data". Create rudimentary city map in just a few clicks! Difficulty low, but little room for customization. | no experience necessary | link |




Editing further; drawing map directly 
- **[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.2.2/)** Free and Open Source SVG Editor 

- **[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)** - Free & Open Source Image Editor

- Adobe Illustrator


## considerations
output internal - dataset, map etc. or external - to share. can make a map from spatial analysis too so can be both 




## options - software 

give each with resources and linked examples of range
