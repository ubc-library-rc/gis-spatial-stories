# Assembling Resources

Once you've articulated your objectives and constraints, and have decided on an output format for your spatial story, it's time to assemble the necessary resources. This involves further consideration of your project design and some key questions from the beginning of this workshop. Take moment to elaborate on them in your worksheet if needed.

> - What skills do you have that are relevant to the project you are undertaking? Are you looking for something quick and straightforward, or do you have time/interest/capacity to experiment and learn new skills? Reflecting on just how much energy you can put into the project at hand will guide you in choosing what tools/platforms to construct your spatial story with.

> - What software, tools, platforms do you have access to? Are you looking for a free and open-source option, or do you have the budget for a paid subscription? Is code development a deal breaker? 

> - Will you need to update and maintain this work over a long period of time or is it a one-off project? Will people other than yourself need access to edit and modify it? 


The following group of pages will guide you through assembling your data and technical resources, as well as provide documentation for troubleshooting along the way. An elaboration on various tools/platforms is broken down by those related to **Static Maps & Spatial Analysis**, those relevant to **Web Mapping**, those for building **Narrative spatial stories**, and those for **Georeferencing**. However, many tools/platforms relate to more than one kind of endeavor, and some endeavors will require more than one tool/platform. While designing a workflow for getting your story made is outside the scope of this workshop, bring your projects to Day Two and we will do our best to collectively help get you started. 



### UBC Resources for Spatial Story Design

Finally, it is useful to make a list of resources that can support you along your journey. This could be tutorials, colleagues, supervisors, or consultants. UBC Library Research Commons offers 1:1 and group consultations for GIS related questions, as well as questions regarding Data Analysis, Digital Scholarship, Citation Management: [Book a consult here](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/appointments/research_commons). There are also numerous workshops from all of these clusters you can work through asynchronously: [see workshop archive here](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/). Keep in mind consultations offered through the Research Commons are aimed at assisting you as you work through your project rather than creating a methodology for you.
