# Assembling Resources

Once you've articulated your objectives and enabling constraints and decided on an output format that best suits the story you want to tell, it's time to assemble the necessary resources. This involves a bit of consideration, thinking with your constraints... Returning to some of the project design questions now more clearly relevant...

1. Assemble and Prepare Data
2. Decide on tools/platforms
3. Design workflow 
4. troubleshooting etc. 

## 1. Assemble your Data

- resources for finding data etc. 
- note where you're storing it and licenses/attribution etc, where you got it from
- make any modifications/transformations (FME is good for interoperability and gives out student licenses)

- How to determine what's so spatial about your data.... 
		(st addressses, then geocode)
		(given cities, spatial join to city layer in qgis OR add columns for xy data - copy paste from google maps )
		(coordinates, display xy )
		(draw layer aoi in qgis)
	^this all shows the myriad of ways data can be spatial 
    spatializing data --> (geocoding, displaying xy data)
	data analysis 
- also note on making data format legible to software/tool you want to use... 

<!-- what is your data type? are there any location based attributes?
 (street address, geographic coordinates, city, town, country?) is there a map? (skills: geocoding, georeferencing, projecting) -->
