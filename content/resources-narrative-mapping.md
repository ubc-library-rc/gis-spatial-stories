## ArcGIS Storymaps

### What it is
Proprietary 
You have to make all the maps and graphics yourself - storymaps is like the aesthetic containter that collages your inputs together

### Examples
- [Mapping Amazon 2.0](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/144d21045a794cf8b7834b0c49fdd0c0)
- [City of Abbotsford](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9d2a3452e2a141399ae6226a627b4a36)
- [Isolation Psychogeography](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4ab243f6d7b3490bbfa884d18a788236)
- [Resilient Woodlands](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2e02a0b503fb469d8e66fd53a482dffd)

### Pros and Cons
- Pro: straightforward to learn, out of the box templates 
- can add multimedia, including images, audio, maps (static and dynamic), and embed videos

- Con: Propriety, 
- Con: need account, licensing can be a hastle and you'll only have editing access so long as you have an account. Only those with AGOL/storymaps accounts can collaborate on a storymap with you.
