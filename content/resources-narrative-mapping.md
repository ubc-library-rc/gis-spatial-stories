## Esri ArcGIS Storymaps
[Esri ArcGIS Storymaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) is a popular service for creating a narrative map with a website feel. Note that Esri ArcGIS Storymaps differs from their new product *StoryMaps*, which is basically just a glorified social media story. ArcGIS Storymaps has a low learning curve. If you are faculty or student at UBC, you can learn more about obtaining access [here](https://gis.ubc.ca/software/#:~:text=FOR%20STUDENT%20PERSONAL%20COMPUTERS&text=This%20%2420%20license%20includes%20ArcGIS,reduced%20cost%20is%20also%20available.&text=This%20is%20a%20non%2Drefundable,installed%20on%20personal%20computers%20only.).


> #### Storymaps Advantages  ⇡
> {: .no_toc}
> - Straightforward to learn, with easy drag-and-drop components
> - Produces aesthetic out-of-the box visuals
> - Can contain multimedia, including images, audio, and static maps as well as dynamic maps made with ArcGIS Online
> - See Esri's [Introduction to ArcGIS Storymaps](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/get-started/what-is-arcgis-storymaps.htm) to get started.


> #### Storymaps Disadvantages ⇣
> {: .no_toc}
> - ArcGIS Online is proprietary, meaning it is not free to use
> - Licensing is a hassle, and collaboration can only occur between people who both own an active license
> - Once your license lapses, your project will disappear
> - You have to make all the maps and graphics yourself, the Storymap is simply the aesthetic container that gathers all the components together

Purdue University has a [tutorial](https://library.pfw.edu/timemapper) if this is a tool you're interested in learning.
