# Static Maps
{: .no_toc}

What are static maps? Different kinds of static maps (remember, speaking to non geospatial experts)for each, give description and image example, as well as reasons you might make one or the other. The following breaks down some possible reasons to make a static map...

## Reference Maps
What are reference maps? When is it useful? 
Reference maps are useful for providing spatial context, such as identifying the location of a city or region of interest. 
Resources --> you can use GIS but also google maps and some other options. (Should I put resources and evaluation breakdown here or under the Assembling resources page??) 


### Resources for making static reference maps
 > - (include resources here? or under assembling resources page? or break the subpages for Determining Output into These subcategories instead of Static/Dynaic? If I include under Assembling Resources, I can both break down the different softwares and provide resources for learning them...  Is there a way to simply hint here to what tools to look further into in the next section)

## Thematic Maps & Spatial Analysis
**Spatial anlaysis** Static maps can also render the results of spatial analysis - if thats more complex. --- book consult with gis team if you're not sure... 

What is spatial analysis? Describe different thematic maps and their use purposes below 

Statistics Canada: "A thematic map shows the spatial distribution of one or more specific data themes for standard geographic areas." 
Thematic maps -->relative density of feature, proportional symbol, choropleth, heatmap. 



questions to ask yourself to determine if this option suits your project.... 


Use GIS to perform spatial analysis and create static thematic maps (in dynamic map section indicate that you can make reference or thematic maps to some extent with leaflet or mapbox.)

- Choropleth Map
[axis map intro to choropleth map design](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/choropleth)  
Showing two variables at once? try making[bivariate choropleth map in QGIS](https://bnhr.xyz/2019/09/15/bivariate-choropleths-in-qgis.html)

- Heatmap

- Dot Density Map

- Cartogram 

- Proportional Symbol map (can also be made using inkscape or adobe illustrator)

## Georeferencing a scanned map/image
historical map, scanned something etc... describe what georeferencing is and why you might want to do it. 
What do you hope to gain from georeferencing? How might georeferencing be useful in your area of research? There are many reasons one might want to georeference a historical map, included, but not limited to the following

- to render maps query-able by location or attribute data
- to add as a project basemap
- to make comparison calculations
- to serve as reference for creating shapefiles for spatial analysis or reference - mapping

### Resources for georeferencing 

often with GIS --> QGIS --> see Koerner Library Research Commons Workshop on [Georeferencing with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-georeferencing/)
