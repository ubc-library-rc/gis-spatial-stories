## Thematic Maps & Spatial Analysis
 Static maps can also render the results of **Spatial anlaysis**. Spatial analysis - done in geographic information system (GIS). desktop software applications downloaded from web to local computer. -- if your data questions are spatial, relative density of feature, if you want to xyz, you'll likely need to perform some kind of spatial analysis. remember, you can always book consult with gis team if you're not sure.

Spatial analysis --> output thematic maps. Use GIS to perform spatial analysis and create static thematic maps. Statistics Canada: "A thematic map shows the spatial distribution of one or more specific data themes for standard geographic areas." [Understanding Thematic Maps](https://mapscaping.com/what-is-a-thematic-map/) Let's take a look at some examples of different kinds of thematic maps.

<!-- cartogram and dot density require plugins in qgis-->

### Proportional Symbol map 
(can also be made using inkscape or adobe illustrator)
> parks per vancouver neighborhood
