# Determining the output

Determining your output.... what does this mean? Why is it important?

There are two ways to share a spatial story: either a static or dynamic visual. **Static maps** tell a spatial story at a single scale. Static maps can be exported/stored/formatted as an image (.jpeg or .png), can be exported as a pdf, printed or embedded digitally into website or publication. They can be included in an academic paper, poster, or flyer. **Dynamic maps**, on the other hand, allow the user to interact with your spatial story. Dynamic display data in --- way -- at multiple scales, allowing zoom in and out and panning. They are not designed to be printed out, but rather hosted on the web either by a local server or internet hosting platform. 

<!-- Between these categories, various forms. This workshop will focuses on tools that support 5 general kinds of output:

- Reference Maps 
- Thematic Maps
- Georeferenced maps
- Web maps
- Narrative maps
-->

<!-- Questions to ask/considerations to think through which is best for you/ your project. the sub-pages walk you through how to do each and give free and open source options at a variety experience levels.  -->

?? Maybe give example of reference map both as static image and web map. Give example of choropleth symbol map as both static and web. Still need to consider how to introduce platforms and resources. maybe this page can be to further work out the most suitible output format, and then the tools/platform/resources page can offer a variety of ways to make that format given constraints on time/resources/skills 

This intro page does what? the subpages do what? clean up what subpages are included 

The following subpages break down different kinds of outputs with examples.... static and dynamic ... you can have static and dynamic reference maps for example...
