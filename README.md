# Spatial Stories
    
How do I tell spatial stories with my data? What tools and mediums best suit my audience, skillset, resources, and timeframe? This workshop will guide you through answering these questions. Rather than focusing on a single software or technical workflow, participants will be introduced to a variety of methods and platforms while learning to evaluate each for its applicability/suitibility to the task/dataset/story at hand. Think of this workshop as a wayfinding tutorial for navigating what questions to ask yourself at the beginning of a project comprising spatial data. 

### When & Where
This workshop will initially be facilitated across two afternoons of GIS week, Day/Time/Location and Day/Time/Location. The first day wil focus on ~methodology and (decision trees) and modality (giving resources/examples). The second day we will go through exemplar project to put into practice skills learned in session one. Additionally, participants are invited to bring their own projects/datasets so as to work together applying what learned. 

### Prerequisites
Attendance in session 1 is prerequisite for attendance in session 2. (any other prerequisites?)


### Audience
Not sure if this workshop is for you? Audience: Digital Humanties people, Geographers, and anyone who wants to make a reference map for their article or have spatial data they want to analyze. Etc. 

----

### Considerations 
Introduce tools/resources at a variety of complexity levels. People don't always have a month to make a map. Maybe they want to add a spatial activity to their class assignment. 

Offer free and open source software (FOSS) alternatives to $$ and proprietary software. Include documentation and useful Youtube explainer videos beneath tools. 

Is the spatial story auxiliary to the rest of the project? Integrated? Is the output a Visualization of spatial analysis? Reference map? Educational resource? Interactive? What medium best suites the story, skills, audience, and timeframe at hand? 

Give examples of kinds of static maps (eg heatmap) for data viz and what tools (eg qgis) can make that happen. 

### Techniques

Making a map to illustrate a spatial idea.

Geocoding.

Georeferencing.
