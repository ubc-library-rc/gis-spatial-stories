# Initial Brainstorm

*How do I find spatial themes in my data? What story do I want to tell? Which tools and mediums best fit my desired outcome, current skillset, and timeframe?* 
    
### Goal
Design a workshop for developing the skills to tell spatial stories with data. This workshop is not about teaching one single software or technical workflow but rather learning to ask strategic questions so as to determine what stories to tell and how to go about doing it. This workshop could potentially be carried out over two sessions. In the first session, we would focus methodology (decision trees) and resources/examples. In the second session, we could invite participants to bring their own dataset and work together (or be led through an exemplar) to put into practice skills learned in session one. (Bringing a dataset would not be a requirement for attendance, though participation in session 1 would be prerequisite.)

This workshop is like a wayfinding tutorial for navigating what questions to ask and what tools to use to tell the spatial stories of data. 
    
### Considerations 
Introduce tools/resources at a variety of complexity levels. People don't always have a month to make a map. Maybe they want to add a spatial activity to their class assignment. 

Offer free and open source software (FOSS) alternatives to $$ and proprietary software. Include documentation and useful Youtube explainer videos beneath tools. 

Is the spatial story auxiliary to the rest of the project? Integrated? Is the output a Visualization of spatial analysis? Reference map? Educational resource? Interactive? What medium best suites the story, skills, audience, and timeframe at hand? 

Give examples of kinds of static maps (eg heatmap) for data viz and what tools (eg qgis) can make that happen.
