# Spatial Stories
    
*How do I tell spatial stories with my data? What tools and mediums best suit my audience, skillset, resources, and timeframe?* This workshop will guide you in answering these questions. Rather than focusing on a single software or technical workflow, participants will be introduced to a variety of methods, tools, and platforms while learning to evaluate each for its applicability to the spatial story at hand. Think of this workshop as a wayfinding tutorial for navigating what questions to ask yourself at the beginning of a project comprising spatial data. By the end of this workshop series, participants will be able to:

- Design a project to tell a spatial story with your data
- Identify suitable methods/tools/platforms of spatial visualization to best represent research idea 
- Inventory and assemble the necessary resources to begin

## When & Where
This workshop will be launched across two afternoons of GIS week 2024: **Wednesday, November 20th & Thursday, November 21st, from 1 - 3pm PST**. The first day will introduce you to tools, methods, and platforms as well as techniques for project design. On the second day, participants will be guided through an exemplar project to put into practice project design skills learned in session one. Additionally, participants are encouraged to bring their own projects/datasets to work through as an applied learning exercise.

## Prerequisites
Attendance in session 1 is prerequisite for attendance in session 2.  

## Audience
*Unsure if this workshop is for you?* Geospatial novices are welcome! This workshop is intended for anyone interested in telling a spatial story with their data or visualizing their research area.
