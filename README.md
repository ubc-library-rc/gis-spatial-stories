# Spatial Stories
    
Description: *How do I tell spatial stories with my data? What tools and mediums best suit my audience, skillset, resources, and timeframe?*  During the workshop, participants will be guided through key concepts of project design. Participants will also be introduced to a variety of mapping tools, and given the opportunity to evaluate which platforms and methods best suit your data, audience, and research objectives.

*Unsure if this workshop is for you?* This workshop is intended for anyone interested in telling a spatial story with their data or visualizing the geographic context of their research area. Geospatial novices are welcome!
